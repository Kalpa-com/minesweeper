# Minesweeper Take-home Assignment
Hi there! Welcome to Kalpa's take-home assignment for front end engineering candidates. This project is designed to give us insight into your problem-solving skills, technical abilities, and how you think about and structure code. We expect the task to take around 2-3 hours to complete, but if it’s taking longer, please reach out so we can guide you to focus on a specific part. We understand you may be balancing multiple assignments, and we want to be considerate of your time.

## Task Overview
Your objective is to create a working version of Minesweeper. If you’re unfamiliar with the game, it’s widely available online. Here’s an [ad-free version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game).

### Functional Requirements:
- Your game should accept three input parameters: the board's width, the board's height, and the number of mines.
- Clicking a tile should reveal its contents: either a blank space, a number between 1 and 8, or a mine.
- The game continues until the player uncovers all non-mine squares or they click on a mine, which results in a loss.

### Technical Guidelines:
- You’re free to use any libraries, frameworks, or technologies you prefer, though our preference would be to use React for at least part of the application.
- While we suggest using mostly front-end tools, feel free to use anything you believe will enhances your solution.
- The final product must run in the latest version of Chrome (no need for polyfills or anything like that).

### Suggestions:
- **Design isn't crucial**—don’t worry about making the interface beautiful, but ensure that your code is organized and the structure is easy to follow.
- There are many existing solutions out there; while we encourage research, avoid simply copying code.
- Keep the scope manageable! Focus on building a basic, functional version of the game first, and if time allows, consider adding a feature that demonstrates your skills.
- Make frequent commits so we can observe your process. We use the [red-green-refactor](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/tdd-red-green-refactor) method often, so it’s perfectly fine to share work in progress as long as you’re satisfied with the final product.

Once you’ve completed the project, please push your code to a repository that we can see (private with access or public). Include a few notes about your thought process, areas you'd focus on more if you had to do another iteration of the assigment, and any feedback you have on the assignment. Clear communication is always appreciated!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via email or phone. We look forward to seeing your solution!
